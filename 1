  Eli’s coaching targets 10 clients at $2,000/month for $20k revenue with 5-6 hrs/week workload. IMPORTANT  
May 20, 2025: Travel from Greece (Kanakia) to Israel ~2.5-3 weeks, then Balkan stays (Albania/Montenegro).  
Considering Albanian coastal towns (Orikum, Dhërmi, Himarë, Qeparo, Borsh) for nomad base; prefers small, beachside, remote with basic amenities.  
Orikum: affordable food (600 Leke half chicken+rice ≈5.4 Euro), proper grocery within 200-300m, some rundown areas.  
Vlora near Orikum: kid-friendly amenities (parks, Scooby Doo bouncy castle), walkable, attractive for family life.  
Weighing Vlora (walkable, more amenities, less car need) vs Orikum (quieter, cheaper housing, car required).  
Albania long-term car rentals (2-3 months) $600-$2,700; early booking advised; economy cars preferred; summer higher rates.  
Car rental ~$400-500 monthly adds cost, offsets Orikum housing savings; fuel costly at $1.85/L; Vlora more walkable, Orikum less.  
Prefers car + remote, cheaper place for flexibility despite higher total spend; Albania cheaper than Greece on food.  
Airbnb: Orikum 1BR $1200-$1400 CAD/mo, 2BR $1600-$1800; Vlora $200-$300 more; Orikum+car ~$2200-$2300 CAD/mo est.

User splits locations as ‘base’ for long stays vs ‘short stay’ travel destinations with different criteria.  
Son Tom (11) plans to write a book; considering Wattpad, Stone Soup; safety/supervised use important (under 13).

CRITICAL: May 1, 2025 meeting with Ansh ended current business/follow-up model; shifting to inbound leads via LinkedIn content, podcast, fewer clients.  
IMPORTANT: Inauthentic outreach causes emotional discomfort; authentic, energy-aligned approach preferred; content creation attracts right clients.  
IMPORTANT: Resistance/procrastination signals avoiding inauthentic work; plans to track content topics via Github-style checkboxes for authentic posting.  
May 1, 2025 21:29 Athens time; noticed hunger triggered discomfort linked to business anxiety after discussing The Big Leap with Yael.  
Updating 'Founder Sales System' course: converting video to book + supplemental materials; no new videos; focus on authentic marketing.  
Priced course at $250 USD, up from $40; hesitation due to subconscious blocks about passive income and being paid without active work.  
Transforming 2-hr video course into book, worksheets, Q&A, articles using AI transcripts; preserving own creative style.  
LinkedIn + high-touch coaching attracted high-value prospects (Jan, Arif); reinforces importance of authentic, energy-aligned work over outsourcing/passive income.
